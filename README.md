## A place to try out some arduino concepts
You must have an Arduino Uno (or compatable). 
You must have Arduino Ide ~1.8.8 (or better).

This branch plays around with the concept of manipulating and rgb led with various sensors.

We mostly use freely availible code from online to try out different concepts. This project is for educational purposes only.
